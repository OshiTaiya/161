    <h3> You Can Call Me Oshi</h3>
    
    <p>I am in my 3rd semester here at LaGuardia CC and I have a passion for cinemtaic videography.</p>
    <p>I also love to travel and have hopes of becoming a nomad after I graduate.</p>
    <p>My plan is to become a freelancer in order to enjoy my love for travel. Even as a child, I couldnt see myself having a traditional 9-5.</p>
    <p>Through my New Media Technology degree I plan to become a consistent content creator with a dynamic set of skills so that I can fund my passions.</p>
    
    <h3>HUW 161</h3>
    
    <p>This is my first project for my HUW161 class.</p>
    <p>Last semester I took an introductory course on HTML and CSS. The coding process was fun and the class furthered my intrests in web design.</p> 
    <p>I'm excited about how design focused this class is. Last semester, I was limitted in how creative I could get with the websites design.</p>
    <p>Learning about color theory and typography are some of the things we hadnt touched on last semester. Being ablle to learn them now is going to be awesome and I cant wait to apply what I learned, and create a beautiful website.</p>
